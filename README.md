# Remote-write

Tool for pushing OMB test results to thanos-receiver.

It expects json file with results generated by [mk-performce-tests](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/mk-bin-packing/mk-performance-tests).

It only sends these results:

- `consumeRate`
- `endToEndLatencyAvg`
- `publishLatency99pct`
- `publishRat`

Tool assumes that it is executed right after OMB test finishes and that samples are taken every 10s. It will add timestamps to samples accordingly.

To build run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/jhellar
cd ~/go/src/github.com/jhellar
git clone https://github.com/jhellar/remote-write.git
cd remote-write
